# Research-Paper
I'm transitioning from a career in neuroscience to becoming a data analyst. As many of the skills I've developed as a scientist are transferable to data analysis I'd like to showcase relevant skills as part of my portfolio:

## Summary
[This scientific research paper](JOE220204.pdf) has been authored by me and written in collaboration with colleagues from the University Hospital in Hamburg and the Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Hamburg. It's about behavioral and molecular neurobiology.  
The study investigated the role of a specific estrogen receptor called GPER1 in mice and found that it has different effects in males and females. In male mice lacking GPER1, anxiety was reduced, while in female mice, the fear response was increased, especially when estrogen levels were high. Both male and female mice with GPER1 deficiency had problems with spatial learning and memory. The study also found changes in brain activity and certain proteins in these mice, suggesting that GPER1 plays a complex and sex-specific role in brain function, which could be related to cognitive and mood disorders.

## Skills

1. **Analytical Skills:** Emphasize your strong analytical skills developed during your career as a scientist. Mention your ability to critically analyze complex data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions. Explain how these skills can be applied to data analysis in various contexts.

2. **Quantitative and Statistical Skills:** As a neuroscientist, you likely have experience with statistical analysis of experimental data. Showcase your proficiency in statistical software (e.g., R or Python) and your understanding of hypothesis testing, p-values, and confidence intervals. Mention any specialized statistical techniques you used in your research.

3. **Data Management:** Describe your experience in collecting, organizing, and managing data in your research. Highlight your attention to detail and data integrity. Discuss any data-related challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.

4. **Programming Skills:** If you have experience with programming languages like Python or R in your research, make sure to include this in your portfolio. Provide examples of code you've written for data analysis, visualization, or modeling.

5. **Data Visualization:** Showcase your ability to create effective data visualizations. Include graphs, charts, and figures from your research paper to demonstrate your skills in presenting data in a clear and informative way.

6. **Machine Learning and Modeling:** If you have used machine learning or modeling techniques in your research, mention this in your portfolio. Explain the algorithms you used and their applications, if relevant.

7. **Domain Knowledge:** Your background in neuroscience can be an asset in certain data analysis roles, especially in fields like healthcare or life sciences. Highlight your domain-specific knowledge and how it can be leveraged in data analysis within that industry.

8. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Describe how you tackled complex research questions in neuroscience, emphasizing your problem-solving abilities. Employers value individuals who can apply critical thinking and creativity to solve data-related challenges.

9. **Communication Skills:** Mention your experience in presenting your research findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Effective communication is crucial for data analysts when conveying insights to stakeholders.

10. **Your Research Paper:** Incorporate your published paper into your portfolio. Summarize the research question, methodology, key findings, and the impact of your work. If applicable, discuss any data analysis techniques you used in your research.

11. **Personal Projects:** If you have completed any personal data analysis projects or coursework related to data analytics, include them in your portfolio. This demonstrates your commitment to transitioning into the field.

12. **Continuous Learning:** Highlight any courses, certifications, or workshops you've completed to enhance your data analysis skills, especially if they are recent.

13. **References and Recommendations:** Consider including letters of recommendation from colleagues or mentors who can vouch for your analytical abilities and your potential as a data analyst.

Remember to tailor your portfolio to the specific data analyst roles you're applying for and emphasize the skills and experiences most relevant to each job description. With a well-crafted portfolio that showcases your transferable skills, you can demonstrate your readiness to excel in the field of data analysis.
