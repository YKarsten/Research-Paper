# Research-Paper
I'm transitioning from a career in neuroscience to becoming a data analyst. As many of the skills I've developed as a scientist are transferable to data analysis I'd like to showcase relevant skills as part of my portfolio:

## Summary
[This scientific research paper](JOE220204.pdf) has been authored by me and written in collaboration with colleagues from the [Institute of Neuroanatomy](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/neuroanatomy/index.html) and the [Research Group Behavioral Biology](https://www.uke.de/english/departments-institutes/institutes/research-group-behavioral-biology/index.html) of the Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Hamburg. It's about behavioral and molecular neurobiology.  
The study investigated the role of a specific estrogen receptor called GPER1 in mice and found that it has different effects in males and females. In male mice lacking GPER1, anxiety was reduced, while in female mice, the fear response was increased, especially when estrogen levels were high. Both male and female mice with GPER1 deficiency had problems with spatial learning and memory. The study also found changes in brain activity and certain proteins in these mice, suggesting that GPER1 plays a complex and sex-specific role in brain function, which could be related to cognitive and mood disorders.

## Skills

1. **Analytical Skills:** Working on this scientific project required meticulous planning and careful analysis of the generated data. As I was responsible for the behavioral analysis, I had to plan experiments in a way that reduce the amount of animals used while still being able to produce statistically significant results. Being limited by the amount of data I could generate and the nonlinear relationship we observed between sexes and estrogen levels I had to critically analyze complex data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions. Finding patterns and meaningful implications in big datasets is a skill that I can transfer from science to data analysis.

2. **Quantitative and Statistical Skills:** As a neuroscientist, I have experience with statistical analysis of experimental data. I have experience with a variety paramteric and non-parametric tests, like student's t-test, ANOVA, MANOVA, linear regression, chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U Test, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test. A applied these tests for different scientific projects throughout my studies. For the present study we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for normal distribution and ANOVA analysis for behavioral data. To apply these tests I have used mainly SPSS, Graphpad Prism, Excel and R-Studio.

3. **Data Management:** All of the behavioral experiments I conducted were video recorded for subsequent analysis and documented on paper protocols, in my personal labbook and a shared digital labbook. This way the data is well archived and organized in a way that other scientists can pick up were I left to continue on the project. Each video file I recorded was named according to a schema that represented the most important information: animalID - Experiment Abbreviation - Timestamp. After analysis of the video files I created corresponding excel files that stored the relevant data for each experiment, this file shared the same naming convention without the animalID field. To keep track of the animal experiments, their sex, birthdate, age during the experiment and especially their cycle stage I created a common excel file for all animals. Properly named files were stored in a folder structure to represent the cohorts of animals as they were tested. Since I didn't rely on legacy code or files I was able to build a data management system I'm well used to as I use it for my personal files as well.  

4. **Programming Skills:** If you have experience with programming languages like Python or R in your research, make sure to include this in your portfolio. Provide examples of code you've written for data analysis, visualization, or modeling.

5. **Data Visualization:** The figures in the paper were created with GraphPad Prism. Showcase your ability to create effective data visualizations. Include graphs, charts, and figures from your research paper to demonstrate your skills in presenting data in a clear and informative way.

6. **Machine Learning and Modeling:** If you have used machine learning or modeling techniques in your research, mention this in your portfolio. Explain the algorithms you used and their applications, if relevant.

7. **Domain Knowledge:** Your background in neuroscience can be an asset in certain data analysis roles, especially in fields like healthcare or life sciences. Highlight your domain-specific knowledge and how it can be leveraged in data analysis within that industry.

8. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Describe how you tackled complex research questions in neuroscience, emphasizing your problem-solving abilities. Employers value individuals who can apply critical thinking and creativity to solve data-related challenges.

9. **Communication Skills:** Mention your experience in presenting your research findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Effective communication is crucial for data analysts when conveying insights to stakeholders.

10. **Your Research Paper:** Incorporate your published paper into your portfolio. Summarize the research question, methodology, key findings, and the impact of your work. If applicable, discuss any data analysis techniques you used in your research.

11. **Personal Projects:** If you have completed any personal data analysis projects or coursework related to data analytics, include them in your portfolio. This demonstrates your commitment to transitioning into the field.

12. **Continuous Learning:** Highlight any courses, certifications, or workshops you've completed to enhance your data analysis skills, especially if they are recent.

13. **References and Recommendations:** Consider including letters of recommendation from colleagues or mentors who can vouch for your analytical abilities and your potential as a data analyst.

Remember to tailor your portfolio to the specific data analyst roles you're applying for and emphasize the skills and experiences most relevant to each job description. With a well-crafted portfolio that showcases your transferable skills, you can demonstrate your readiness to excel in the field of data analysis.
